/*

In many list-processing operations, we must process each node in the list in sequence; this is called traversing a list. 
To traverse a list in order, we must start at the list head and follow the list pointers till the last node.
The list can be traversed by using the assignment PTR:= LINK[PTR], which moves the pointer to the next node in the list. 
The algorithm for traversal can written as follows:

Algorithm: This algorithm traverses a list applying an operation print to each element of the list. 
1. PTR = START. 
2. While PTR â‰  NULL.
3.     Print INFO[PTR].
4.     PTR = LINK[PTR].
5. End
6. Exit

The algorithm starts with initializing PTR. Then process INFO[PTR], the information at the first node. 
Update PTR by the assignment PTR:=LINK[PTR], and then process INFO[PTR], 
the information at the second node and so on until PTR=NULL, which signals the end of the list.

class LinkList
{
  public int Data; // data item
  public LinkList next; // next link in list
  
  public LinkList(int id) // constructor
  {
    Data = id; // initialize data and 'next' is automatically set to null
  }

  {
    System.out.print(Data + "-> ");
  }
}

{
  public static void traverse(LinkList first)

    LinkList current = first; // start at beginning of list
    while(current != null) // until end of list,
    {
      current.display(); // print data
      current = current.next; // move to next link
    }
    System.out.println("");
