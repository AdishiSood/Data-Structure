# 🎁 Data Structure- Complete Roadmap 🎁
This repository consists of all the necessary questions and their solutions required for cracking technical interviews. And this content will surely help you to crack your dream company. This material has been taken and combined from various different sources. It will be a complete roadmap for your placement prep.

# 🚀 Getting Started
The folders above consist of all the required questions and their solutions as well, according to each topic

I will keep on updating this repository, If I feel that anything is missing.

Let me know, if you wish to add anything else to this content.

# 🏆 What do I need to prepare for the interviews?
To get your dream company, you should be good in the following while facing an interview:

**📘Solid Data Structures and Algorithms.** Deep understanding of these subjects, how to combine them, how to find/design suitable ones for a problem, etc. This is not surprising as indeed these are the most foundational topics on which much of CS rests.

**📘Strong in OOPS.** OO Design and principles, subtle aspects of language, strong understanding of the language capability and limitations, its design and implementation.

**📘Good understanding of OS, DBMS, Networks.** These subjects were highlighted whose understanding is extremely important on being a successful software engineer for high-end work.

**📘Ability to write well structured and efficient code.** Ability to evaluate efficiency of the code at different levels – algo, DS, execution level (OS), hardware to reduce memory as well as time; understanding of different layers of the system, and ability to evaluate/assess the program at these different layers.

# Some of the languages used at various organisations as reported online:
* 📙 Amazon: Java, Javascript, Ruby, Python, Perl sources
* 📙 Facebook: PHP, C++, Python, Java, Perl. High regard for dynamic/scripting languages. sources
* 📙 Google: C/C++, Java, Python, Javascript, Go sources
* 📙 Microsoft: C++, C#, Java, Python sources


_Tip: Go for the language you are comfortable with, doing any kind of problem, solving things and writing code AND also please know about the internal functionalities as well and how different data structures are implemented in it.
