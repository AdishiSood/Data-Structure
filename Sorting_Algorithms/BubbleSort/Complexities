Time Complexity Analysis-
 
- Bubble sort uses two loops- inner loop and outer loop.
- The inner loop deterministically performs O(n) comparisons.
 

Worst Case-
 
- In worst case, the outer loop runs O(n) times.
- Hence, the worst case time complexity of bubble sort is O(n x n) = O(n2).
 

Best Case-
 
- In best case, the array is already sorted but still to check, bubble sort performs O(n) comparisons.
- Hence, the best case time complexity of bubble sort is O(n).
 

Average Case-
 
- In average case, bubble sort may require (n/2) passes and O(n) comparisons for each pass.
- Hence, the average case time complexity of bubble sort is O(n/2 x n) = Θ(n2).
 

The following list summarizes the time complexities of bubble sort in each case-

- Time Complexity
- Best Case	O(n)
- Average Case	Θ(n2)
- Worst Case	O(n2)
 

From here, it is clear that bubble sort is not at all efficient in terms of time complexity of its algorithm.
